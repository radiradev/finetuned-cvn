# The DUNE Convolutional Visual Network for neutrino interaction classification

This software is provided as a minimal working example of the DUNE Convolutional Neural Network (CVN) as supplemental material to the article "Neutrino interaction classification with the DUNE Convolutional Visual Network" <insert reference when available>.

## 1. Introduction to the CVN

The CVN classifies neutrino interaction images from the DUNE far detector. Each event consists of three 500 x 500 pixel images in (wire number, time) parameter space. Twenty such example interactions from the DUNE simulation are provided to demonstrate the usage of the CVN software. Please see the article for a full description of the input and outputs of the CVN algorithm.

## 2. Usage instructions

To run the example, simply use:

```
python test.py
```

This will produce a file called results.txt in the ./output directory. This can be compared to [./output/expected_results.txt](output/expected_results.txt) to ensure the code has executed correctly.

There are a number of arguments that can be used to change file paths, etc. The full list of these is given below:

| Parameter                 | Default       | Description   |	
| :------------------------ |:-------------:| :-------------|
| --batch_size 	       |	10          |Batch size

| --weights         |        'saved_model/weights.h5'          |HDF5 pre-trained model weights
| --dataset         |        'dataset'          |Dataset path
| --partition         |        'dataset/partition.p'          |Pickled partition
| --shuffle         |        False          |Shuffle partition
| --print_model         |        False          |Print model summary
